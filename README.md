You can add Bootstrap variables to the `bootstrap.scss` file. You can look at the file `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss` for a list of all the variables. Do NOT edit the `variables.scss` file directly, as it will be overwritten when you update Bootstrap.

To add your own custom styles, use the `styles.scss` file.
